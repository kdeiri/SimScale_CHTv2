# SimScale_CHTv2
A repo that allows running CHTv2 simulations on SimScale via the API

This repository was created and tested on a proprietary CAD model which was removed.
Hence, running the script as it is, will definietly fail. One would need to adjust the needed settings in the _main.py file.
The code itself however, should work as a good starting point on how to interact with the SimScale API for such cases. 

In the near future, further enhacements on this repo will be added and of course with a working example that could be available to the public.
